Exponential expansions of $\sin(z)$
%
$$
\sin(\theta) = \frac{e^{i\theta} - e^{-i\theta}}{2i} = \frac{z - z\inv}{2i},~~d\theta = \frac{dz}{iz}

Rouche's Theorem
%
If $f, g$ are holomorphic on $\bar{D}(z_0)$ and $\abs{f - g} < \abs{f} + \abs{g}$ on $\bd D$, then $f,g$ are nonvanishing on $\bd D$ and have the same number of zeros.

Cauchy-Goursat Theorem
%
If $f$ is analytic on a simply connected region $\Omega$ containing a contour $\gamma$, then $\int_\gamma f = 0$.
Moreover, this holds for any contour $\gamma \subset \Omega$.

Types of singularities
%

- Removable: $\abs{f(z)}$ is bounded in a punctured disc.
- Poles: $\lim_{z\to p} \abs{f(z)} = \infty$.
- Essential: neither removable nor a pole.
