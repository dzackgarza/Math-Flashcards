Eisenstein's Criterion

%
If $f(x) = \displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^n \alpha_i x^i \in \QQ[x]$ and $\exists p$ such that

- $p$ divides every coefficient *except* $a_n$ and
- $p^2$ does not divide $a_0$,

then $f$ is irreducible.

Algebraic Field Extension

$K[x]$
%
The algebra of polynomials in the variable $x$, i.e. $K[x] = \theset{\sum_{i=0}^n a_ix^i \suchthat n\in \ZZ^{\geq 0}}$.

Descartes' Rule of Signs
%
The number $r_+$ of positive real roots of a polynomial $p(x)$ are at most the number $n$ of sign changes in the coefficients.
Moreover, $r$ is *exactly* $n-2k$ for some $k\in \ZZ^{\geq 0}$.
Similarly, the number $r_-$ of negative real roots is the same idea applied to $p(-x)$.

Examples: $x^3 + x^2 - x - 2$ has at most one real root.
