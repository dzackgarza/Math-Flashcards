Eisenstein's Criterion

%
If \(f(x) = \displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^n \alpha_i x^i \in \QQ[x]\) and $\exists p$ such that

- $p$ divides every coefficient *except* $a_n$ and
- $p^2$ does not divide $a_0$,

then $f$ is irreducible.

Algebraic Extension
%
A field extension $L/K$ is **algebraic** $\iff$ every $\alpha \in L$ is the root of some polynomial $f(x)\in K[x]$.
%
definition

Normal Extension
%
A field extension $L/K$ is **normal** $\iff$ every irreducible $p(x) \in K[x]$ either has no roots in $L$ or splits into linear factors in $L[x]$.
%
definition
---

Separable Extension
%
A field extension $L/K$ is **separable** $\iff$ for every $\alpha \in K$, the $\min_\alpha(x)/K$ is separable (equivalently, has nonzero derivative).

definition

$K(x)$
%
The field of rational functions, i.e. ratios of polynomials, in the variable $x$; 
\[K(x) = \theset{{P(x) \over Q(x)} \suchthat P,Q \in K[x]}.\]

Example: $\CC(x)$ is the field of meromorphic functions on the Riemann sphere.

Four Characterizations of Galois extensions $K/F$.
%

1. $K$ is a splitting field of a separable polynomial in $F[x]$.
2. $K$ such that the fixed field of $\aut(K/F)$ is exactly $K$.
3. $K$ such that $[K:F] = \abs{\aut(K/F)}$.
4. $K$ such that $K/F$ is finite, normal, and separable.

Definition of Galois group for a **finite** extension $K/F$.
%
$K/F$ is Galois $\iff$ $\abs{\Aut(K/F)} = [K: F]$
%
definition

Example of a field extension that is not Galois.
%
$K = \QQ(2^{1\over 3})/\QQ$, since $\abs{\aut(K/\QQ)} = 1$ but this is a degree 3 extension.
