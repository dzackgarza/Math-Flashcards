Characteristic of a ring
%
The smallest number $n$ such that \(\sum_{j=1}^n 1_R = 0_R\).

Equivalently, the kernel $n\ZZ$ of the unique map $\ZZ\to R$.

Zorn's Lemma
%
If every chain in a poset $P$ has an upper bound in $P$, then $P$ contains a maximal element.

Note: a *chain* is a totally ordered subset.

theorem

Zero Divisor
%
An element $r\in R$ is a *zero divisor* if there exists an \( x\in X \) such that \( rx=0\).

Equivalently, the map $x\mapsto rx$ is *not* injective.

Definition: irreducible.
%
A nonzero nonunit ring element \(r\in R\) is *irreducible* iff $r=ab$ implies $a$ or $b$ is a unit.

Definition: prime.
%
A nonzero nonunit ring element $r$ is prime iff $r\divides ab$ implies $r\divides a$ or $r\divides b$.

Gauss' Lemma
%
Let $R$ be a UFD with fraction field $F$ and $p \in R[x]$.
If $p$ is reducible in $F[x]$, then $p$ is reducible in $R[x]$.

> Implies that $R$ a UFD implies $R[\theset{x_i}]$ is again a UFD.

Definition: prime ideal.
%
An ideal $\mathfrak{p}\normal R$ is prime iff it is proper and $ab\in \mathfrak{p} \implies a\in \mathfrak{p}$ or $b\in \mathfrak{p}$.

Definition: Maximal ideal.
%
An ideal $I\normal R$ is *maximal* iff $I\subseteq J \normal R$ implies $J=R$.

Definition: Euclidean domain.
%
Admits a "remainder measuring" function $f: R\setminus\theset{0} \to \NN$ such that $a\in R, b\in R^\bullet$ implies there exist $q, r\in R$ such that $a = bq + r$ with either $r=0$ or $f(r) < f(b)$.

Definition: Unique Factorization Domain
%
Every nonzero element $x\in R$ can be written as \(x = u\prod p_i\) where the \(p_i\) are irreducible and $u \in R^\times$.

This decomposition is unique up to multiplication by a unit, and a permutation of the factors $\sigma$ that makes each \(p_i\) associate to \(p_{\sigma(i)}\)
