Characteristic of a ring
%
The smallest number $n$ such that \(\sum_{j=1}^n 1_R = 0_R\).

Equivalently, the kernel $n\ZZ$ of the unique map $\ZZ\to R$.

Zorn's Lemma
%
If every chain in a poset $P$ has an upper bound in $P$, then $P$ contains a maximal element.

Note: a *chain* is a totally ordered subset.

Zero Divisor
%
An element $r\in R$ is a *zero divisor* if there exists an \( x\in X \) such that \( rx=0\).

Equivalently, the map $x\mapsto rx$ is *not* injective.
