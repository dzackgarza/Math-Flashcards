Does $A^n=B^n$ imply $A=B$?
%
No, counterexample: $M^2 = [0, 1; 1, 0]^2 = I_2$.
\[  
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 \
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
.\]

Characterizations of Diagonalizability of a Square Matrix $M$
%

- $\min_M(x)/\FF$ splits into distinct linear factors over $\FF$ (i.e. is separable)
- $\FF$ contains all of the roots of $\min_M(x)/\FF$
- There exists a basis of $\FF^n$ consisting of eigenvectors of $M$
- All elementary divisors are linear
- (Sufficient) $M$ has $n$ distinct eigenvalues
- (Sufficient) $\min_M(x)/\FF$ has $n$ distinct roots.
