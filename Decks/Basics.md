Descartes' Rule of Signs
%
The number $r^+$ of positive real roots of a polynomial $p(x)$ are at most the number $n$ of sign changes in the coefficients.
Moreover, $r$ is *exactly* $n-2k$ for some $k\in \ZZ^{\geq 0}$.
Similarly, the number $r^-$ of negative real roots is the same idea applied to $p(-x)$.

Examples: $x^3 + x^2 - x - 2$ has at most one real root.
