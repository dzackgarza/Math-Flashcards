Sylow Theorems
%
Write $\abs{G} = p^n m$ with $(p, m) = 1$.

# Sylow 1

Writing $\abs{G} = \prod p_i^{n_i}$, there exist Sylow $p_i\dash$subgroups $P_i$ of order $p_i^{n_i}$ for every $i$.

## Sylow 2

All Sylows are conjugate.

# Sylow 3

1. $n_p$ divides $m$
1. $n_p \equiv 1 \mod p$
2. $n_p = [G: N_G(P)]$

Recognizing Direct Products
%
When there exist two subgroups $H, K \leq G$ such that

1. $H\intersect K = \emptyset$
2. $G = HK$
3. $H$ and $K$ are both normal.

Composition Series
%
A **composition series** of $G$ is a sequence of subgroups
\begin{align*}
1=N_{0} \leq N_{1} \leq N_{2} \leq \cdots \leq N_{k-1} \leq N_{k}=G
\end{align*}
such that $N_i \normal N_{i+1}$ and the *composition factors* $N_{i+1}/N_i$ are simple.
