What is: Definition of separated and proper morphisms,
%
We say a variety $X$ is separated if the image of the diagonal map $\Delta: X \rightarrow X \times X$ is Zariski closed in $X \times X$.

For instance, $\mathbb{C}^n$ is separated because the image of the diagonal in $\mathbb{C}^n \times \mathbb{C}^n=$ $\operatorname{Spec}\left(\mathbb{C}\left[x_1, \ldots, x_n, y_1, \ldots, y_n\right]\right)$ is the affine variety $\mathbf{V}\left(x_1-y_1, \ldots, x_n-y_n\right)$. Similarly, any affine variety is separated.

What is a proper morphism? What are some consequences?
%

Definitions: 

- A morphism of schemes is proper if it is universally closed, separated, of finite type.

- A morphism of algebraic varieties $\phi: X \rightarrow Y$ is proper if it is universally closed, i.e., if for all $\psi: Z \rightarrow Y$, the mapping $\phi^{\prime}: X \times \times_Y Z \rightarrow Z$ is a closed mapping in the Zariski topology.

Important things to note about properness:

(a) $X$ complete iff the structure morphism to a point is proper.
(b) Fibers of a proper morphism are complete.
(c) Inverse images of complete subvarieties of $Y$ are complete.
(d) Any morphism obtained from base change from a proper morphism is automatically proper

When is a toric variety Calabi-Yau?
%
If the fan $\Sigma$ of $X_{\Sigma}$ has all its primitive generators lying on a hyperplane of $N_{\mathbb{R}}$, then $X_{\Sigma}$ is Calabi-Yau.

Proof. Let $D_i$ be all the toric divisors with corresponding primitive generators $u_i$. If all the primitive generators lie on a hyperplane, then we can choose a basis for $N$ such that the first coordinate of each of them is 1 , i.e. $u_{i n}=1$. But then:
\[
0 \sim \operatorname{div}\left(\chi^{e_1}\right)=\left\langle e_1, u_1\right\rangle D_1+\cdots+\left\langle e_1, u_r\right\rangle D_r=\sum D_i .
\]
Hence, since $X_{\Sigma}$ is toric,
\[
\mathcal{K} \cong \mathcal{O}_{X_{\Sigma}}\left(-\sum D_i\right) \cong \mathcal{O}_{X_{\Sigma}},
\]
where $\mathcal{O}_X(D)$ is the sheaf of the Weil divisor $D$. Consequently the canonical divisor is trivial and $X_{\Sigma}$ is Calabi-Yau.

%
A ring $R$ with field of fractions $K$ is **normal** if every element of $K$ which is integral over $R$ (i.e. a root of monic polynomial in $R[x]$ ) is actually in $R$. 

A variety $X$ is **normal** if it is irreducible and the local rings $\mathcal{O}_{X, p}$ are normal for all $p \in X$.

What is: Checking smoothness
%

Let $\sigma \subseteq N_{\mathbb{R}}$ be a scrapc,

- $\sigma$ is **smooth** if its minimal generators form part of a $\mathbb{Z}$-basis for $N$.
- $\sigma$ is **simplicial** if its minimal generators are linearly independent over $N_{\mathbb{R}}$.

What is $\sigma\dual$?
%

The dual of a cone $\sigma$ is
\[
\sigma^{\vee}:=\left\{u \in M_{\mathbb{R}}:\langle u, v\rangle \geq 0 \forall v \in \sigma\right\}

What is the canonical sheaf of a toric variety?
%
Theorem 8.2.3. For a toric variety $X_{\Sigma}$, the canonical sheaf $\omega_{X_{\Sigma}}$ is given by
\[
\omega_{X_{\Sigma}} \simeq \mathscr{O}_{X_{\Sigma}}\left(-\sum_\rho D_\rho\right) .
\]
Thus $K_{X_{\Sigma}}=-\sum_\rho D_\rho$ is a torus-invariant canonical divisor on $X_{\Sigma}$.
