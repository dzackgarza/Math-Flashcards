Retract
%
Retract: A subspace $A \subset X$ is a *retract* of $X$ iff there exists a continuous map $f: X\to A$ such that $f\mid_{A} = \id_A$. 
Equivalently it is a *left* inverse to the inclusion.

Deformation Retract
%
Deformation Retract: A subspace $A \subset X$ is a *deformation retract* of $X$ iff there exists a morphism $F:X\cross I$ to $X$ such that $F(x, 0) = x, F(x, 1)\in A, F(a, 1) = a$.
Equivalently it is a homotopy between a retraction and the identity.

Locally Compact
%
A space $X$ is *locally compact* iff for every $x\in X$ there exists an open $U$ and compact $K$ such that $x\in U \subseteq K$.

Compact implies locally compact but not conversely: $\RR^n$.

Non locally-compact spaces: $\QQ, \theset{\vector 0} \union \theset{(x, y) \suchthat x>0} \subset\RR^2$ (since the origin admits no compact neighborhood).

Example of a function that is Lebesgue integrable but not Riemann integrable
