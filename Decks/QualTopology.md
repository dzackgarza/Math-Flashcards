Retract
%
Retract: A subspace $A \subset X$ is a *retract* of $X$ iff there exists a continuous map $f: X\to A$ such that $f\mid_{A} = \id_A$. 
Equivalently it is a *left* inverse to the inclusion.

Deformation Retract
%
Deformation Retract: A subspace $A \subset X$ is a *deformation retract* of $X$ iff there exists a morphism $F:X\cross I$ to $X$ such that $F(x, 0) = x, F(x, 1)\in A, F(a, 1) = a$.
Equivalently it is a homotopy between a retraction and the identity.
