Proof of Borel-Cantelli Lemma
%
*Proof of Borel Cantelli:*
 
- If \(E = \limsup_j E_j\) with \(\sum m(E_j) < \infty\) then $m(E) = 0$.
- If $E_j$ are measurable, then \(\limsup_j E_j\) is measurable.
- If \(\sum_j m(E_j) < \infty\), then \(\sum_{j=N}^\infty m(E_j) \converges{N\to\infty}\to 0\) as the tail of a convergent sequence.
- \[E = \limsup_j E_j = \intersect_{k=1}^\infty \union_{j=k}^\infty E_j \implies E \subseteq \union_{j=k}^\infty\] for all $k$
- \[E \subset \union_{j=k}^\infty \implies m(E) \leq \sum_{j=k}^\infty m(E_j) \converges{k\to\infty}\to 0.\]

Nowhere Dense
%
A set is $A$ **nowhere dense** if its closure has empty interior $\qty{\bar A}^\circ$, equivalently it is not dense in *any* nonempty open set.
For $\RR$, every interval $I$ contains a subinterval $S\subset I$ with $S\intersect A = \emptyset$, i.e. its closure contains no intervals.

Intuition: elements are not tightly clustered, set is full of holes.

Is a composition of Lebesgue measurable functions measurable?
%
No:

- Take $f: [0, 1]\to [0, 1]$ the Cantor-Lebesgue function (monotonic and cts) and $C$ the Cantor set
- $f(C) = [0, 1]$, so define $g(x) = f(x) +x$ so $g:[0, 1] \to [0, 2]$ (strictly monotonic and cts, so a homeomorphism), so $g\inv$ is cts and thus measurable.
- $\mu(g(C)) = 1>0$ (because $f$ is constant on every interval in $C^c$) so $g(C) \supseteq A$ a non-measurable subset
- $g\inv(A) \subset C$ with $\mu(C) = 0$ implies $g\inv(A)$ is a measurable set, so $\chi_{g\inv(A)}$ is a measurable function
- Then \(k\definedas \chi_{g\inv(A)} \circ g\inv\) isn't measurable since 
  \[ 
  k\inv(1) = \qty{ (g\inv)\inv \circ \chi_{g\inv(A)} }(1) = g(g\inv(A)) = A
