Definition: A pole $a$ of order $m$
%
The smallest $m$ such that 
\[
\lim_{z\to a}(z-a)^{m+1}f(z) < \infty \text{ but } \lim_{z\to a}(z-a)^{k\leq m} f(z) = \infty
.\]

Definition: A removable singularity
%
A pole of order zero, so 
\[
\lim_{z\to z_0}f(z) < \infty
\]
and $f$ is bounded on some neighborhood of $z_0$.

Definition: An essential singularity
%
An isolated singularity that is not a pole (or removable).
\[
\lim_{z\to z_0 } f(z) \text{ DNE }
.\]

Normal family
%
A family of functions $\mcf \da \ts{f_j}_{j\in J}$ is **normal** iff every sequence $\ts{f_k}$ has a subsequence that converges locally uniformly, i.e. $\ts{f_{k_i}}$ converges uniformly on every compact subset.

Equicontinuity
%
A family of functions $f_n$ is **equicontinuous** iff for every $\eps$ there exists a $\delta = \delta(\eps)$ (not depending on $n$ or $f_n$) such that 

\[
\abs{x-y}<\eps \implies \abs{f_n(x) - f_n(y)} < \eps
\qquad \forall n
.\]
