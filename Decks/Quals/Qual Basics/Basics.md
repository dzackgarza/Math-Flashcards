Descartes' Rule of Signs
%
The number $r^+$ of positive real roots (counted with multiplicity) of a polynomial $p(x)$ are at most the number $n$ of sign changes in the coefficients.
Moreover, $r^+$ is *exactly* $n-2k$ for some $k\in \ZZ^{\geq 0}$.
Similarly, the number $r^-$ of negative real roots is the same idea applied to $p(-x)$.
The minimal number of nonreal roots is thus $n - (r^+ + r^-)$.

*Examples:*

- $f(x) = x^3 + x^2 - x - 1$ has at exactly 1 positive real root.
- $f(-x) = -x^3 + x^2 + x - 1$ has either 2 or 0 positive real roots, so $f$ has 2 or 0 negative real roots.
- $g(x) = x^3 - 1$ has exactly 1 positive real root,  $g(-x) = -x^3 - 1$ has 0 positive roots, so $g$ has 2 complex roots.
