Hahn-Banach Theorem
%
If $p: V\to \RR$ is a sublinear function and $\phi: U\to \RR$ a linear functional on $U\leq V$ with $\phi \leq p$, then there exists a $p\dash$sublinear extension $\tilde \phi: V\to \RR$

Riesz Representation Theorem
%
For $H$ a Hilbert space and $\varphi \in H\dual$, there exists an $f\in H$ such that $x\in H \implies \varphi(x) = \inner{f}{x}$ with $\norm{f}_H = \norm{\varphi}_{H\dual}$.
