Eisenstein's Criterion

%
If $f(x) = \displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^n \alpha_i x^i \in \QQ[x]$ and $\exists p$ such that

- $p$ divides every coefficient *except* $a_n$ and
- $p^2$ does not divide $a_0$,

then $f$ is irreducible.

Algebraic Field Extension
%
A field extension $L/K$ is **algebraic** iff every $\alpha \in L$ is the root of some polynomial $f(x)\in K[x]$.

Normal Field Extension
%
A field extension $L/K$ is **normal** iff every irreducible $p(x) \in K[x]$ either has no roots in $L$ or splits into linear factors in $L[x]$.

Separable Field Extension
%
A field extension $L/K$ is **separable** iff for every $\alpha \in K$, the $\min_\alpha(x)/K$ is separable (equivalently, has nonzero derivative).
