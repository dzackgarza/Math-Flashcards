Dirichlet's Test
%
If \(\theset{a_n}, \theset{b_n}\) satisfy

- \(  a_n \searrow 0\) 
- For every $N$, there exists an \(M_N\) such that \(  \abs{\sum_{n=1}^N b_n} \leq M_N\)

Then \[ \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n b_n < \infty .\]

Casorati-Weierstrass Theorem
%
- If $f$ is holomorphic on \(\Omega\setminus\theset{z_0} \subseteq \CC\) where \(z_0\) is an essential singularity and \(V\subseteq \Omega\) then \(f(V\setminus\theset{z_0}) \injects \CC\) is dense.
- If $f$ is non-constant and entire then \(f(\CC)\injects \CP^1\) is dense.
