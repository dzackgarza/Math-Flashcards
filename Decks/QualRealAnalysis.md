Proof of Borel-Cantelli Lemma
%
*Proof of Borel Cantelli:*
 
- If $E = \limsup_j E_j$ with $\sum m(E_j) < \infty$ then $m(E) = 0$.
- If $E_j$ are measurable, then $\limsup_j E_j$ is measurable.
- If $\sum_j m(E_j) < \infty$, then $\sum_{j=N}^\infty m(E_j) \converges{N\to\infty}\to 0$ as the tail of a convergent sequence.
- $E = \limsup_j E_j = \intersect_{k=1}^\infty \union_{j=k}^\infty E_j \implies E \subseteq \union_{j=k}^\infty$ for all $k$
- $E \subset \union_{j=k}^\infty \implies m(E) \leq \sum_{j=k}^\infty m(E_j) \converges{k\to\infty}\to 0$.

definition

Nowhere Dense
%
A set is $A$ **nowhere dense** if its closure has empty interior $\qty{\bar A}^\circ$, equivalently it is not dense in *any* nonempty open set.
For $\RR$, every interval $I$ contains a subinterval $S\subset I$ with $S\intersect A = \emptyset$, i.e. its closure contains no intervals.

Intuition: elements are not tightly clustered, set is full of holes.

Counterexample: $\theset{1 \over n}, \ZZ$ are nowhere dense, $\QQ, \ZZ\union \qty{(a, b)\intersect \QQ}$ is *not* nowhere dense

The family $F$ is *uniformly equicontinuous* iff $\delta(\eps)$ only depends on $\eps$ and holds for any pair $x_1, x_2$ with $x_1 \in B_\delta(x_2)$.
