Egorov's Theorem
%
If $E\subset \RR^n$ is measurable, $m(E) > 0$, and $\theset{f_n}$ measurable with $f_k \to f$ with $f(x) < \infty$ existing and finite a.e., then $f_n\to f$ *almost uniformly*, i.e.
for all $\eps > 0$ there exists a closed $F\subset E$ such that $m(E\setminus F)<\eps$ and $f\converges{u}\to f$ on $F$.

Proof of Borel-Cantelli Lemma
%
*Proof of Borel Cantelli:*
 
- If $E = \limsup_j E_j$ with $\sum m(E_j) < \infty$ then $m(E) = 0$.
- If $E_j$ are measurable, then $\limsup_j E_j$ is measurable.
- If $\sum_j m(E_j) < \infty$, then $\sum_{j=N}^\infty m(E_j) \converges{N\to\infty}\to 0$ as the tail of a convergent sequence.
- $E = \limsup_j E_j = \intersect_{k=1}^\infty \union_{j=k}^\infty E_j \implies E \subseteq \union_{j=k}^\infty$ for all $k$
- $E \subset \union_{j=k}^\infty \implies m(E) \leq \sum_{j=k}^\infty m(E_j) \converges{k\to\infty}\to 0$.

First and Second Category
%

- A subset is *first category* iff it is an (arbitrary) union of nowhere dense sets
- A subset is *second category* otherwise.

Nowhere Dense
%
A set is **nowhere dense** if its closure has empty interior, equivalently it is not dense in *any* nonempty open set.

Intuition: elements are not tightly clustered.

Counterexample: $\theset{1 \over n}, \ZZ$ are nowhere dense, $\QQ, \ZZ\union \qty{(a, b)\intersect \QQ}$ is *not* nowhere dense

Equicontinuous
%
For $X, Y$ metric spaces and $\mcf$ a family of functions, $F$ is *equicontinuous at $x_0$* iff for every $\eps > 0$ there exists a $\delta(\eps, x_0)>0$ such that $x\in B_\delta(x_0) \implies f_i(x) \in B_\eps(f_i(x_0))$ for all $f_i \in \mcf$.
The family $F$ is *uniformly equicontinuous* iff $\delta(\eps)$ only depends on $\eps$ and holds for any pair $x_1, x_2$ with $x_1 \in B_\delta(x_2)$.
