Definition: A pole $a$ of order $m$
%
The smallest $m$ such that 
\[
\lim_{z\to a}(z-a)^{m+1}f(z) < \infty \text{ but } \lim_{z\to a}(z-a)^{k\leq m} f(z) = \infty
.\]

Definition: A removable singularity
%
A pole of order zero, so 
\[
\lim_{z\to z_0}f(z) < \infty
\]
and $f$ is bounded on some neighborhood of $z_0$.

Definition: An essential singularity
%
An isolated singularity that is not a pole (or removable).
\[
\lim_{z\to z_0 } f(z) \text{ DNE }
.\]
