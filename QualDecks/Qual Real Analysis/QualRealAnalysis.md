If \(\theset{f_n} \subset L^+\), then

*Proof of Borel Cantelli:*
 
- If \(E = \limsup_j E_j\) with \(\sum m(E_j) < \infty\) then $m(E) = 0$.
- If \( E_j\) are measurable, then \(\limsup_j E_j\) is measurable.
- If \(\sum_j m(E_j) < \infty\), then \(\sum_{j=N}^\infty m(E_j) \converges{N\to\infty}\to 0\) as the tail of a convergent sequence.
- \[E = \limsup_j E_j = \intersect_{k=1}^\infty \union_{j=k}^\infty E_j \implies E \subseteq \union_{j=k}^\infty E_k \quad \forall k \]
- \[E \subset \union_{j=k}^\infty \implies m(E) \leq \sum_{j=k}^\infty m(E_j) \converges{k\to\infty}\to 0.\]
