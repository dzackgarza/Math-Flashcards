Young's Inequality
%
For \(1\leq p, q\leq r \leq \infty  \) with \({1\over p} + {1\over q} - {1\over r} = 1  \), then  \(\norm{f\ast g}_r \leq \norm{f}_p \norm{g}_q \) 

Useful cases:
\[\begin{align*}
\norm{f\ast g}_1 & \leq \norm{f}_1 \norm{g}_1 \\
\norm{f\ast g}_p & \leq \norm{f}_1 \norm{g}_p \\
\norm{f\ast g}_\infty & \leq \norm{f}_p \norm{g}_q \\
\norm{f\ast g}_\infty & \leq \norm{f}_2 \norm{g}_2 
\end{align*}\]

First and Second Category
%

- A subset is *first category* iff it is countable union of nowhere dense sets.
- A subset is *second category* otherwise.
%
definition

Nowhere Dense
%
A set is $A$ **nowhere dense** if its closure has empty interior $\qty{\bar A}^\circ$, equivalently it is not dense in *any* nonempty open set.
For $\RR$, every interval $I$ contains a subinterval $S\subset I$ with $S\intersect A = \emptyset$, i.e. its closure contains no intervals.

Intuition: elements are not tightly clustered, set is full of holes.

Counterexample: $\theset{1 \over n}, \ZZ$ are nowhere dense, $\QQ, \ZZ\union \qty{(a, b)\intersect \QQ}$ is *not* nowhere dense

Equicontinuous
%
For $X, Y$ metric spaces and $\mathcal{F}$ a family of functions, $F$ is *equicontinuous at \(x_0\)* iff for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists a \(\delta(\varepsilon, x_0)>0\) such that \[x\in B_\delta(x_0) \implies f_i(x) \in B_\varepsilon(f_i(x_0))\] for all \(f_i \in \mathcal{F}\).
The family $F$ is *uniformly equicontinuous* iff $\delta(\varepsilon)$ only depends on $\varepsilon$ and holds for any pair \(x_1, x_2\) with \(x_1 \in B_\delta(x_2)\).

Characterizations of $D_f$, the set of discontinuities of functions
%

- Always \(F_\sigma\), closed, positive oscillation.
- \(f_n\to f\) with \(f_n\) continuous \(\implies D_f\) is meager.
- (Lebesgue criterion) \(f \in \mathcal{R}(a, b)\) and bounded \(\implies D_f\) is null.
- $f$ monotone \(\implies D_f\) is countable, and additionally $f$ differentiable on \((a, b) \implies D_f\) is null.

Baire Category Theorem

Is a composition of Lebesgue measurable functions measurable?
%
No:

- Take $f: [0, 1]\to [0, 1]$ the Cantor-Lebesgue function (monotonic and cts) and $C$ the Cantor set
- $f(C) = [0, 1]$, so define $g(x) = f(x) +x$ so $g:[0, 1] \to [0, 2]$ (strictly monotonic and cts, so a homeomorphism), so $g\inv$ is cts and thus measurable.
- $\mu(g(C)) = 1>0$ (because $f$ is constant on every interval in $C^c$) so $g(C) \supseteq A$ a non-measurable subset
- $g\inv(A) \subset C$ with $\mu(C) = 0$ implies $g\inv(A)$ is a measurable set, so $\chi_{g\inv(A)}$ is a measurable function
- Then \(k\definedas \chi_{g\inv(A)} \circ g\inv\) isn't measurable since 
  \[ 
  k\inv(1) = \qty{ (g\inv)\inv \circ \chi_{g\inv(A)} }(1) = g(g\inv(A)) = A
  \]
  is not a measurable set.

Uniform Boundedness Principle
%
If $\mathcal{F}$ is a family of bounded operators \(T_n:X\to Y\) between Banach spaces with 
\[  
\forall x\in X, \qquad \sup_{T_n \in \mathcal{F}} \norm{T_n(x)}_Y < \infty
,\]
then \(\sup_{T_n\in \mathcal{F}} \norm{T_n}_X < \infty\).

> Slogan: pointwise bounded sequences of operators are uniformly bounded.
