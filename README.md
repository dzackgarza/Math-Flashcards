# Instructions

- You'll need a working installation of [Python 3](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)
- (Optional) Install [ankdown](https://github.com/benwr/ankdown). If you have pip, you can just run something like `pip3 install --user ankdown`.
  - Alternative: I've included my own modified copy of `ankdown.py` that can just be run directly by either
    - Running `chmod +x ankdown.py` and subsequently `ankdown.py ...`
    - Running `python3 ./ankdown.py ...`
-
